(i) name, email address, photograph and precise or general geo-location;<br>
(ii) purchase information based on your activities on the App or Services;<br>
(iii) ordering, billing and other similar information you provide to purchase an item or service
(which may also be captured by the app store that processes the details of your payment);<br>

statistics on your practice, achievement of milestones, etc.;<br>
(v) community discussions and posts, messages, dispute resolution, correspondence through
the App and Services, and correspondence sent to us;<br>
(vi) computer sign-on data, statistics on page views and traffic to and from the App or Services;<br>
(vii) other technical information or data collected from App or Services traffic, including IP
address and standard web log information;<br>
(viii) information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device
identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about
your use of our Services<br>
(ix) Facebook profile information, such as name, email address and Facebook ID, if you choose
to log into the App and user our Services through Facebook.<br>
(x) supplemental or additional information we may request from you in the event previous
information you've provided cannot be verified; and<br>
(xi) information that you voluntarily provide to us.<br>
<p>When you use the App we may collect and store information about your location (general or
precise) by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile
device's GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We
may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not
want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device. You
can stop all collection of information via the App by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your
device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the
use of information collected about you. You can stop all collection of precise location data
through the App by uninstalling the app or withdrawing your consent through your device
settings.</p>
<p>If you choose to invite a "Friend" to use the App and our Services, we will ask you for their email
address. We will use this information to invite him or her to join the App. We store this
information for the sole purpose of sending invitations. If you ask us to do so by providing your
consent, we may also send e-mails inviting your friends from your 'Contacts' list.
If your Friend would like us to delete his or her information, they can do so by opting-out as
described in each invitation or by contacting us at support@kgp2ssindia.in.
Third Party Resources Including Third Party Tracking Technologies
We also use the services of third parties to help us to collect various data about you and the
way that you use the App in order to enable us to better understand your interests â€“ both so that
we can service content to you that we think will be of interest to you, and so that we can ensure
that you are shown adverts delivered by third parties which are more likely to be of interest to
you.</p>
<p>We may collect information from your company or employer, including your contact data; social
networks when you engage with our content, reference our Service, or grant us permission to
access information from the social networks; Research Partners (as defined below) that
analyze information for research and statistical purposes; and publicly-available sources,
including data in the public domain.</p>
<p>We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access
and use the Service. In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other
technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and
services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their
platforms as well as on other websites and services.</p>
<p>As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service
(including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and
services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services
for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or
other content to you ("Interest-based Advertising").</p>
<p>Vendors and other parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts,
independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself
with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>
<p>For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the Service and your
rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, and Matched Ads, please
see the "Your Rights and Choices" section.</p>
<p>You may remove cookies from your computer at any time.</p>
<p>Please note that we will not ask (and are not required by law to ask) for your consent to deliver
cookies which are strictly necessary for us to offer our App and/or Services to you, or to monitor
the volume of traffic that passes through our App or websites.</p>
<p>For details of the cookies that we use on our App and/or our website, what those cookies do,
and the privacy policies of the third parties which provide them (where relevant) please see our
Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>Unless specifically set out in our Cookies Policy, we rely on our legitimate interests as our
condition for processing your personal data on the basis set out in this section (specifically that
we have a legitimate interest in optimising the App content and ensuring that you are served
with relevant commercial communications as you use them).<p>
C. How do we use your personal information?<br>
<p>We may combine your information with information we collect from other sources to improve the
App. We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties, in the
traditional sense of the word "sell," for their marketing purposes without your prior consent.
You agree that we may use your personal information as specified in the Terms of Service, and
to:<p>
(i) fulfil the purposes disclosed when you provided your information to us;<br><br>
(ii) provide, deliver, and collect payment for the services, products, and customer support you
request;<br><br>
(iii) review and process applications for employment;<br><br>
(iv) resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;<br><br>
(v) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our App- and Service-related
agreements;<br><br>
(vi) customize, measure, and improve our services and the App's content and layout;<br><br>
(vii) provide you with personalized content;<br><br>
(viii) tell you about targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your
communication preferences, to the extent that you have provided us with your consent to
receive such communications under applicable law; and<br><br>
(ix) compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties. Further, we may disclose
personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce Terms of Service or App policies,
in connection with a merger, sale of assets, or other similar corporate transactions, respond to
claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect the rights, property,
or safety or any person.<br><br>
<p>Please note that this Section does not apply to our use of personal information which relates to
your health ('Health Data'). For information on how your Health Data is used, please see below.
If you sign up to receive promotional materials from us via email we will use the information you
give us to provide the communications you have requested.</p>
<p>When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to
"optout" (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the
e-mail you receive). If you no longer wish to receive push notifications through our App, you
may turn them off at the device level.</p>
<p>Please note that we do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services, such
as communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy, and you
will not be able to opt out of those communications</p>
D. Sharing Information<br>
We may share your personal data with:<br>
(i) members of our corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and
provide joint services to requesting users;<br><br>
(ii) service providers, consultants or similar contractors to support or enhance the App or our
business operations, or to whom we contract in order to carry out transactions initiated by you,
such as credit card processing organizations (see "Service Providers" below);<br><br>
(iii) other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom
you are otherwise explicitly notified and solicited consent when using a specific service);
(iv) law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating
to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity;<br><br>
(v) persons we believe in our sole discretion necessary or appropriate in connection with an
investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity;<br><br>
(vi) other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business
entity;<br><br>
(vii) third parties who will use the data for scientific research and study "Research Partners";
and<br><br>
(viii) Where your account with us is connected to the corporate account of your employer or
another organization with which you are affiliated (where your employer, workplace, or other
organization with which you are affiliated provides a subscription to the Services or the App)
data about your usage of the App may be accessible by that organization and may be
personally identifiable to you. While that data is aggregated and intended to enable the
corporate provider to monitor overall usage of the App by its personnel, you may be identifiable
from it if your usage is very different from other members of your organisation or if your
workplace has a small number of individuals who use the service. We may also share such
aggregate information with other organizations in order to provide enterprise subscribers with
the ability to benchmark the wellness activity of their workforce against that of other
organizations. As noted above, while that information will be in aggregate form, you may be
identifiable from it if your usage is very different from other members of your organisation or if
your workplace has a small number of individuals who use the service.<br><br>
We will not share your personal information with third parties in order for that third party to
provide direct marketing communications to you.<br><br>
Notwithstanding the above, we may share information that does not identify you (including
information that has been aggregated or de-identified) except as prohibited by applicable law.
For information on your rights and choices regarding how we share information about you,
please see the "Your Rights and Choices" section below.<br><br>
Service Providers<br><br>
Our service providers provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, and technical
services. We will only provide service providers with the minimum amount of personal
information they need to fulfil the services we request, and we stipulate that they protect this
data and do not use it for any other purpose. We take these relationships seriously and oblige
all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to
respecting individual rights, and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your
rights as a data subject. Our major service providers include a variety of various cloud hosting
companies; and data analytics companies.<br><br>
E. Community Sharing<br><br>
In order to offer the services for which you will use the App or Services, your user ID may
necessarily be displayed throughout the App and Services and to the public, as well as to your
Teams if you are part of the Services used by an enterprise with which you are affiliated. All of
your activities on the App and Services will be traceable to your user ID. Notices are sent to
other community members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations and refer to user
IDs and specific items. Please understand that if you link your name with your user ID, others
will be able to personally identify your activities.<br><br>
Please note that once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it
except as required by applicable law.<br><br>
F. Password and security<br><br>
Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and
special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password
or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken
in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on
your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
access your profile on the App to change your password and notify us immediately at
support@kgp2ssindia.in<br><br>
We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the
information that we collect from or about you from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. No
method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure
and accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.<br><br>
G. For how long do we keep your personal data?<br><br>
We will hold your personal information on our systems only for as long as required to provide
you with the Services you have requested or to perform the purpose for which that data was
collected.<br><br>
Where you sign up to receive e-mail marketing from us we will retain your e-mail address on file
should you ever 'opt-out' of receiving e-mails from us. We will retain your e-mail address in this
way in order to ensure that we continue to honour and respect that opt-out request.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see 'Your Rights' below for further
information.<br><br>
In some circumstances we may de-identify your personal information (so that it can no longer be
associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this data
indefinitely without further notice to you.<br><br>
H. International transfers<br><br>
Your personal information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside
of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may
not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the India
and choose to provide your personal data to us, we may transfer your personal data to the
India and process it there.<br><br>
If you would like more information about how the mechanism via which your personal
information is transferred, please contact <br><br>
I. Applicability<br><br>
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this Policy addresses only the use and
disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether
they are users on the App or other Apps throughout the Internet, different rules may apply.
The App and Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the Services of our
partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these external websites,
please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any
responsibility or liability for these websites or their policies. Please check these policies before
you submit any personal information to these external websites.<br><br>
J. Children<br><br>
The App and Services are not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do
not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from such children. If you are younger
than thirteen, please do not provide any personally identifiable information to us. If a person 13
years of age or younger has provided personal information to us, a parent or guardian of such
person should contact us at support@kgp2ssindia.in so that we can remove such personal
information from our database.<br><br>
We reserve the right to limit participation in particular programs, offers or promotions to those
over 18 years of age.<br><br>
K. Your Rights and Choices<br><br>
EU Data Subject Rights<br><br>
If you are a data subject located in the European Union you have a number of rights in relation
to your personal information. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well
as how you can exercise them.<br><br>
Right of Access<br><p>
You may, at any time, request access to the personal information that we hold which relates to
you (you may have heard of this right being described as a "subject access request").
Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold
about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing
that personal information lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal information
about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your
personal information.<br><p>
You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out
support@kgp2ssindia.in and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not
have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.<br>
Your Right to Rectification and Erasure<br><p>
You may, at any time, request that we correct personal information that we hold about you
which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal information
if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right
described as the "right to be forgotten"). To do this, we recommend that you log into the App or
Services.<br><p>
We will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your
identity remotely. Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us
and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right.
Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal information when asked to do so; if for any
reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal
information that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond
to your request.</p><br><p>
You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your
request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as
reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.<br>
Your Right to Restrict Processing</p><br><p>
Where we process your personal information on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the
sections of this Policy which explain how and why we use your information) you are entitled to
ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your
fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.
We may process your data on the basis of a legitimate interest in the following ways:<br>
- Optimised App content<br><p>
- Track products and services that are popular</p><br><p>
You may also ask us to stop processing your personal information (a) if you dispute the
accuracy of that personal information and want us verify that data's accuracy; (b) where it has
been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
where we no longer need to process your personal information (and would otherwise dispose of
it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or
defend legal claims.</p><br><p>
Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue
processing personal information that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that
reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the
opportunity to consider and investigate it.</p><br><p>
You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out
support@kgp2ssindia.in and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing
the relevant aspect of your personal information and describing which of the above conditions
you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind
of request.</p><br><p>
Your Right to Portability</p><br><p>
Where you wish to transfer certain personal information that we hold about you, which is
processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to
you in a commonly used machine-readable format.</p><br><p>
Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this
right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if
you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.
Your Right to object to automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and
profiling of your personal information, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful
information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
consequences of such processing that affects you.</p><br>
Rights of All Users</p><br><p>
Your Right to stop receiving communications</p><br><p>
Where we send you e-mail marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages)
you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the 'unsubscribe' link that
appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those
communications).</p><br><p>
Alternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us
directly â€“ you can unsubscribe by writing to us at support@kgp2ssindia.in and telling us which
communications you would like us to stop sending you.<br>
Analytics and Advertising</p><br><p>
Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by
Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for
Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.</p><br><p>
The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the
choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the
Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and/or the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn
more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving
certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants,
https://www.aboutads.info/choices; (ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants,
https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices; and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants,
https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Opting out only means that the selected
participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no
longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants' other
customers or from other technology services).</p><br><p>
You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for
purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting "Limit Ad
Tracking" (for iOS devices) or "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads" (for Android devices).
Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the
specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness
of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any other entities'
statements regarding their opt-out options or programs.<br>
Exercising your rights</p><br><p>
When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are entitled to ask you to
prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID
documents to help us to verify your identity.</p><br><p>
It will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and,
where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be,
the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with
sufficient information then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with
additional information (and where this is the case we will tell you).<br>
L. Jurisdiction<br><p>
KGP2-SS INDIA PVT. LTD located in the India, as are the servers that make the App available. All matters
 relating to privacy issues are governed by the laws of the India.</p><br>
M. Policy Changes</p><br><p>
We may amend this Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the App, which will
automatically take effect after they are initially posted except as otherwise specified. If we make
any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your
account) or by means of a notice in the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We
encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy
practices.<br>
N. Contact Details<br><p>
You may contact us at support@kgp2ssindia.in to request access, correction or deletion of any
information we have about you, or to submit questions or complaints about this Policy.</p>
